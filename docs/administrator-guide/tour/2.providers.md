# Providers

We rely on several external providers to host some of our services that are
critical to the proper functioning of our infrastructure. Those services are
necessary to be run by external providers in order to be able to rely on them in
the event of a downtime on our side.

## Git hosting, CI/CD

We host the git repositories describing our infrastructure and our configuration
at GitLab. Currently, the CI for building our hosts in ran on `duck` through
[`shabka`](https://github.com/kalbasit/shabka/) (our configuration manager).

### GitLab

We host our repositories at [GitLab.com](https://gitlab.com). All our
repositories are grouped in the [Lama Corp. Infrastructure
group](https://gitlab.com/lama-corp/infra). Here is an exhaustive list of what
we are using for our infrastructure:

* [`dotshabka`](https://gitlab.com/lama-corp/infra/dotshabka): holds the
  NixOS configuration of our hosts. As of today, it also holds the users'
  personal configuration. This is going to change as part of the development of
  `shabka`. This repository is where you'll work most of the time.
* [`dotshabka-secrets`](https://gitlab.com/lama-corp/infra/dotshabka-secrets):
  as `dotshabka` is a public repository, this is a private one where we hold all
  needed secrets to run our services, like API keys.
* [`nur-packages`](https://gitlab.com/lama-corp/infra/nur-packages): this is
  where we package custom packages for `shabka` or for our services.
* [`shabka`](https://gitlab.com/lama-corp/infra/shabka): this is simply a mirror
  of [`shabka`'s upstream repository](https://gitlab.com/lama-corp/infra/shabka)
  in case we get fucked by GitHub or Microsoft (never trust anyone, right?).
* [`documentation`](https://gitlab.com/lama-corp/infra/doc): the source of this
  website.
* [`Mirrors`](https://gitlab.com/lama-corp/infra/mirrors): a bunch of mirrors
  of repositories of tools we use for our infrastructure. This is mostly because
  of some paranoia risson's helding.

### Self-hosted

> This section needs expansion. It is not critical to the understanding of the
> infrastructure so it has not been properly completed just yet.

There is currently no CI done on GitLab.com for our infrastructure. Our hosts
are built by `shabka`'s CI, but also by Hercules CI and then pushed to Cachix.

## DNS

Our DNS is managed by [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com). The admin interface
is available at [dash.cloudflare.com](https://dash.cloudflare.com). There,
you'll find the list of domains we manage. If you click on a domain, let's say
`lama-corp.space`, you'll get an overview of the domain. From there, the only
thing you will be using is the `DNS` tab. Here are all our record DNS. As you
can see, they are all DNS only. This is due to the fact that we want to use
Let's Encrypt certificates for our YunoHost instance, and YunoHost checks that
the DNS IP is the same as the public IP of the instance. This implies that we
can't get a certificate while being proxied through Cloudflare. However, if we
ever get in an event where we get DDoSed, we can still enable Cloudflare
proxying to protect us until the certificate expire. There are ways to stay
protected by Cloudflare even if our Let's Encrypt certificate expires, but that
event is unlikely to happen, so we won't be expanding that topic here.

## Servers

As we try to keep our costs at a minimum while having a minimum downtime, we
hosts our critical services with online providers, and the less critical
services are self-managed (understand at home).

### Hetzner

This is where we rent our physical servers. Unfortunately, there is no way to
add a second admin, so risson is the only administrator.

### Google Cloud

> For future use

Google Cloud offers a very small virtual machine for free, so we plan to use it
for external monitoring.

### Self-managed

For now, none of our home-based servers are used in production. This is bound
to change once we have a running k8s cluster and some real backups.
