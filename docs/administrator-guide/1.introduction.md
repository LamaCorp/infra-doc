# Introduction

The administrator documentation will be divided in three parts:

* a tour of the infrastructure, designed to help you familiarize with what's
  running, how it all works and give basic and useful informations about the
  different systems;
* a bunch of tutorials to get you started, like how to add yourself as a user,
  how to get an always-on weechat session, how to run a service. Most of this
  will simply be done by copying existing code and changing variables;
* some quick notes (or basic runbooks, if you want) about how to do something
  on the infrastructure, like how to reboot a server and decrypt its disk by
  ssh-ing to it.
