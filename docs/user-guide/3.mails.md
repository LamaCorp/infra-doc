# Mails

## Desktop or mobile email client

To setup your mail in any application, those parameters should be enough :

**Incoming mail**:

* protocol: `IMAP`
* port: `993`
* encryption: `SLL/TLS`
* authentication: normal password
* username: your name in your email address before the `@`. Ex: `lama`
* server: `mail.lama-corp.space`

**Outgoing mail**:

* protocol: `SMTP`
* port: `587`
* encryption: `STARTTLS`
* authentication: normal password
* username: your name in your email address before the `@`. Ex: `lama`
* server: `mail.lama-corp.space`

## Webmail

We also provide a webmail application for you to check your emails. It is
available at [cloud.lama-corp.space](https://cloud.lama-corp.space) under the
"Mail" application. Here are the steps to set it up:

* select "Auto" if it isn't selected already;
* enter your name, Lama Corp. email address and password;
* click "Connect" (this might take some time);
* you're done!
